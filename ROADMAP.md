# Roadmap <!-- fables-turn roadmap v1 -->

Executor-facing task spec. Each item is sized for ONE Sonnet session. Items are
the single source of truth — TODO.md carries only a summary line. Executors tick
checkboxes; only the reviewer adds, removes, or re-scopes items.

**Scope rule for this repo**: every item below is runnable in the zkm core repo
alone — `plugins/` is empty in a fresh worktree and the suite must stay green
without any plugin repo present. Plugin-repo work stays in TODO.md (central
ledger by design) and is NOT mirrored here.

## Phase 2 "done" definition (CONFIRMED — owner 2026-06-13)

Phase 2 is declared done when all three hold:

1. **γ schema shipped** — DONE (E1–E13 closed 2026-05-21).
2. **Store hygiene + management landed** — DONE (`zkm rm`/`zkm gc` dry-run-first,
   `zkm remote/clone/push/pull` backend-aware).
3. **Observation-period gate** — 14 consecutive days of real-store operation
   (mbsync-triggered converts + manual index/search) with zero manual
   interventions for data integrity (no orphaned CAS objects beyond `zkm gc`
   dry-run noise, no sidecar duplicate-producer recurrences, no run-guard
   false positives). Clock starts when the last [ROUTINE] item below ships;
   any intervention restarts the window.

Rationale: 1–2 are already true, so the binding criterion is 3 — it follows the
"observe before preventing" heuristic and avoids declaring victory on the same
day the last feature merges. FP-rate targets for NER are explicitly NOT part of
the gate (N9c/N9d accepted-as-is decisions stand).

## Items

- [x] Refuse to start convert/scrub/index while the gamemode lock is present [ROUTINE] <!-- id:1098 -->
  (executor 2026-06-12; review-verified 2026-06-12: spec tests byte-identical
  to checkpoint, 6 RED→green confirmed by running them against the checkpoint
  tree. `GAMEMODE_LOCK_DEFAULT` in `runstate.py`, guard inside
  `RunSession.__enter__` before PID write, doctor row informational.
  ARCHITECTURE.md §D7 updated. First half of TODO id:f631.)

- [x] Self-scope `zkm index` under systemd-run for freeze/thaw control [HARD — strong model] <!-- id:62f3 -->
  (done in handoff C5, 2026-06-12: `src/zkm/selfscope.py` + cmd_index hook;
  10 tests in `tests/test_selfscope.py` green; smoke-verified on zomni —
  journal shows zkm-index.scope starting the re-exec'd command. Judgment
  calls flagged in REVIEW_ME.md.)
  - **Why HARD**: environment-dependent (systemd user manager presence,
    `INVOCATION_ID` semantics differ between service and scope units, Termux/
    Raspbian fallback), re-exec must be loop-proof and absolutely must not fire
    inside pytest/CliRunner, and the "scope exists but is frozen" collision
    case needs a judgment call (join-and-block vs fail-clean).
  - **Acceptance**: `zkm index` re-execs itself under
    `systemd-run --user --scope --collect --unit=zkm-index` when not already
    scoped, so `systemctl --user freeze zkm-index.scope` (zomni gamemode
    toggle) can freeze a running index. Skip conditions (run unscoped):
    `ZKM_SELF_SCOPED` set (loop guard, injected on re-exec), `INVOCATION_ID`
    set (already under systemd), `ZKM_NO_SELF_SCOPE=1` (opt-out; autouse in
    conftest), `systemd-run` not on PATH, or any precheck error (fail-open —
    indexing must still work on fievel/pixel). If `zkm-index.scope` already
    exists (frozen or active), exit 75 with a message stating the scope state.
    Second half of TODO id:f631; see zomni meeting note
    2026-06-11-1328-memory-swap-failsafe-llama-swap.
  - **Tests**: `tests/test_selfscope.py` marked `# roadmap:62f3` (written
    red-first during execution; monkeypatch `shutil.which`/`subprocess.run`/
    `os.execvpe` — no real systemd calls in tests).
  - **Done-check**: `uv run pytest tests/test_selfscope.py` (then full suite)

- [x] Skip the amender pass when the triggering convert created zero files [ROUTINE] <!-- id:dd89 -->
  (executor 2026-06-12; review-verified 2026-06-12: spec tests byte-identical
  to checkpoint, 2 RED→green confirmed against the checkpoint tree; both
  GUARDs still green. `not created` branch + skip notice in `cmd_convert`.
  Encoded judgment call — queued amendments wait when zero files are created —
  spawned the id:83c7 observability item below.)

- [x] Conformance: warn when an amender's convert() lacks the `created` parameter [ROUTINE] <!-- id:e1fc -->
  (executor 2026-06-12; review-verified 2026-06-12: spec tests byte-identical
  to checkpoint, 2 RED→green confirmed against the checkpoint tree; both
  GUARDs still green. Warn-level finding in `check_interface` +
  docs/plugin-spec.md §Frontmatter amendments paragraph.)

- [x] Surface the pending amendment queue in `zkm doctor` and the zero-created skip notice [ROUTINE] <!-- id:83c7 -->
  - **Acceptance**: When `<store>/.zkm-state/amendments/` holds ≥1 pending
    record (any emitter subdir), `zkm doctor` prints an `amendment queue` row
    with the total pending count and a per-emitter breakdown, e.g.
    `amendment queue 3  (ner: 2, notmuch: 1)` — informational only (does not
    flip doctor's exit code; mirrors the `gamemode lock` row). No row when the
    queue is empty or absent. Additionally, the id:dd89 skip notice appends
    the pending count when the queue is non-empty:
    `Skipping amenders (0 files created; N queued amendment(s) pending)`;
    the queue-empty message stays byte-identical to today's. User-observable:
    after a no-op mbsync convert, `zkm doctor` shows whether enrichment is
    still waiting — the observation half of the id:dd89 trade-off (queued
    amendments wait for the next non-empty convert or an explicit
    `zkm convert ner`).
  - **Tests**: `tests/test_doctor_amendment_queue.py`, marked
    `# roadmap:83c7`. RED spec:
    `test_doctor_reports_pending_amendment_queue`,
    `test_doctor_queue_row_keeps_exit_code`,
    `test_zero_created_notice_mentions_queued_amendments`.
    Already-green GUARDs (do not break):
    `test_doctor_no_queue_row_when_queue_empty`,
    `test_skip_notice_unchanged_when_queue_empty`.
  - **Done-check**: `uv run pytest tests/test_doctor_amendment_queue.py`
    (then full suite)
  - **Context**: `src/zkm/amendments.py` (`_QUEUE_DIR = ".zkm-state/amendments"`;
    queue files are `<emitter>/<sha1>.json`); `src/zkm/cli.py` `cmd_doctor`
    (informational-row pattern: `gamemode lock`) and `cmd_convert` (skip notice
    from id:dd89). Count = number of `*.json` files under the queue root — do
    NOT parse or validate record contents (cheap row, not a linter). Defer any
    new import inside the function (CLI import-speed convention).
    TODO.md §Amendment contract backlog; ARCHITECTURE.md §D5/§D7 and the
    "observe before preventing" heuristic.

- [x] `zkm doctor --entities`: census of `valid: false` entity slots [ROUTINE] <!-- id:1a6f -->
  - **Acceptance**: `zkm doctor --entities` sweeps the frontmatter of all
    store `.md` files (same exclusions as the existing md-files count: skip
    paths containing `.zkm-index` or `.git` parts) and prints a
    `suspicious entities` row: total count of `entities[]` slots carrying
    `valid: false`, plus a per-type breakdown, e.g.
    `suspicious entities 3  (iban: 2, date: 1)`. With the flag the row prints
    even when the count is 0. Slots with `valid: true` or no `valid` key are
    NOT counted; files with malformed frontmatter are skipped silently
    (doctor is a health report, not a linter). Without `--entities`, doctor
    performs no frontmatter sweep and prints no such row (the sweep is
    O(store) and parses every file — opt-in by design). The row never changes
    doctor's exit code. User-observable: the TODO.md deferral triggers
    ("entity-DB checksum-fail policy at ≥50 `valid: false` entries";
    "`valid: false` forward-flag after ≥1 month observation") finally have a
    counter to read.
  - **Tests**: `tests/test_doctor_entities.py`, marked `# roadmap:1a6f`.
    RED spec: `test_doctor_entities_counts_valid_false`,
    `test_doctor_entities_reports_zero_with_flag`,
    `test_doctor_entities_keeps_exit_code`.
    Already-green GUARD (do not break):
    `test_doctor_default_has_no_entities_row`.
  - **Done-check**: `uv run pytest tests/test_doctor_entities.py`
    (then full suite)
  - **Context**: `src/zkm/cli.py` `cmd_doctor` (reuse the `md_count` rglob
    filter); `python-frontmatter` is already a dependency. γ schema:
    `entities[]` slots are dicts with an optional `valid` bool — see
    docs/entity-model.md and `src/zkm/canonical.py`. ARCHITECTURE.md §D6 and
    the "observe before preventing" heuristic.

- [ ] **Convert the 5 T1 @manual BDD scenarios in features/cli-journeys.feature to executable tests [ROUTINE]** <!-- id:9878 -->
  - **Context**: per `dotclaude-skills/docs/bdd-automation-triage-2026-06-13.md`,
    these 5 scenarios are pure CLI subprocess/file assertions and need no new
    harness: hybrid-search degraded (mock a stopped server), concurrent-lock
    exit 75, gamemode-lock exit 75 (id:1098), no-op amender skip (id:dd89),
    doctor-on-healthy-store. The other 4 scenarios stay `@manual` (fresh-machine
    quickstart, store-hygiene needing a populated CAS store, gamemode-freeze via
    `systemctl` id:62f3, progress-visibility — T2/T4).
  - **Acceptance**: each of the 5 scenarios has an executable test (subprocess
    against a scratch store, asserting exit code / stdout / files); `@manual`
    removed from each converted scenario; the repo's test command is green.
  - **Done-check**: `cd ~/src/zkm && uv run pytest -q` (or the documented test
    command in CLAUDE.md) fully green.

## Pointers (NOT executor items — wrong repo or gated)

- zkm-whatsapp W-series (W6f media manifest, W-key secret source, W8 owner-JID
  autodetect, W10 Syncthing auto-decrypt, W11 number-change tracking) — live in
  `plugins/zkm-whatsapp` (own repo). W9 WAL-safe backup handling shipped
  v0.3.0 (2026-06-11); no core-side blocker remains.
- NER FP backlog (N9c pipe-cell filter, HTML-entity artefacts) — fix paths are
  in zkm-ner / zkm-eml repos per TODO.md; core `scrub.py` is only the dispatcher.
- SOC1–SOC6 zkm-social — gated on GitHub remote + user review (TODO id:e395).
- Stage 2 OIDC trusted publishing — cross-repo CI work across all 7 repos.
